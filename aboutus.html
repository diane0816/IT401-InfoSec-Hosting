        Cafe Rilone offers a unique coffee house environment. We are a place where you can sit-down and enjoy our tailor-made 
        cup of coffee. Our cafe's dream was to bring together people with a good coffee plus a good food. A place where groups
        could come and meet. Meetings could also be held and friends that could get together and linger over laughter and long
        conversation. A place that felt as comfortable as home with an exeptional food and drinks. We look forward to serving 
        you at Cafe Rilone. See You!!!
